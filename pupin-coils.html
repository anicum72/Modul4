<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", 
followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and 
mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven 
years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to 
it were acquired by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), making him wealthy. 
Although AT&amp;T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already 
had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this 
point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&amp;T were afraid they 
would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its 
ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially 
submarine ones.</p>
